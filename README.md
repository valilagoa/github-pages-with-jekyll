# My GitHub Learning Lab Repository for GitHub Pages

Welcome to **my** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guided through. 

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm **not** the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm **not** here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!
